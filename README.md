### Idea:

An interactive banking game that will focus on the critical fundamentals of financial literacy by guiding youths on making responsible financial decisions from a young age.

### Purpose:

Youth financial literacy is often neglected and doesn't get the attention that it deserves. We tend to assume that children will eventually learn about financial concepts as they grow older but somehow, they start to face difficulty as children develop into adults. Through this educational game, our objective is to fill the knowledge gap and avoid the obstacles faced by the transition from youth to adulthood. Kiddy Bank is a banking game that simulates the reality of banking in a fun and interactive way that is targeted towards youth from elementary to middle school. It goes through a series of decision-making situations to teach kids a tool-kit that arms them with basic financial literacy concepts such as learning how to save, invest, budget and earn "Kiddy" bucks.

### What financial skills will the kids learn: 

- How to manage an Online "Kiddy" Bank
- Savings
- Investing
- Budgeting
- Spending
- Loans
- Interest

# WINNER

Kiddy Bank won Bell's Custom Award - to create a solution that will help those who have traditionally been less likely to benefit from technological innovation due to economic instability.
