### Target Audience: 

Elementary and Middle School students

### What financial skills will the kids learn: 

- How to manage an Online "Kiddy" Bank
- Savings
- Investing
- Budgeting
- Spending
- Loans
- Interest

### Purpose:

Youth financial literacy is often neglected and doesn't get the attention that it deserves. We tend to assume that children will eventually learn about financial concepts as they grow older but somehow, they start to face difficulty as children develop into adults. Through this educational game, our objective is to fill the knowledge gap and avoid the obstacles faced by the transition from youth to adulthood. "Kiddy" Bank is a banking game that simulates the reality of banking in a fun and interactive way that is targeted towards youth from elementary to middle school. It goes through a series of decision-making situations to teach kids a tool-kit that arms them with basic financial literacy concepts such as learning how to save, invest, budget and earn "Kiddy" bucks.

### Role of Parents:

In addition, parents play an essential role in their children's lives from beginning to end; hence, we made it a requirement for parents to help their children make effective financial choices by providing them "Kiddy" bucks every time their kids complete a task.
For example, kids can do chores to gain a few "Kiddy" bucks, which they will take the initiative to save, invest or spend through their bank account as this will promote responsible financial choices.
